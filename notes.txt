DISCO
  0. For each of our sorts, instead of returning the ordered list, we returned the number of passes, compares, and swaps.
  1. For each of our sorts, we ran three tests: the best case, the average (random) case, and the worst case.
QCC:
  0. Are there more efficient sorts than Insertion sort and Selection sort?
BUB-QA:
* q0: If a pass requires no swaps, what do you know?
* a0: The entire list is sorted.
* q1: After pass p, what do you know?
* a1: After pass p, the first p - 1 elements are sorted.
* q2: How many passes are necessary to completely sort?
* a2: If n is the number of elements in the list, n - 1 passes are necessary to sort the list.
SEL-QA:
* q0: How many passes to sort n elements?
* a0: n - 1 passes are needed to sort n elements.
* q1: What do you know after pass p?
* a1: After pass p, the first p elements are sorted.
* q2: How do you know if sorted?
* a2: We know the list is sorted after n - 1 passes.
* q3: What does a pass boil down to?
* a3: A pass boils down to one swap.
INS-QA:
* q0: How many passes to sort n elements?
* a0: n - 1 passes are necessary to sort n elements.
* q1: What do you know after pass p?
* a1: After pass p, the first p + 1 elements are sorted.
* q2: How will you know when sorted?
* a2: If n is the number of elements in the list, we will know the list is sorted after n - 1 passes.
* q3: What constitutes a pass?
* a3: A pass a traversal of the first p + 1 elements. A pass is also when an element in the unsorted region is placed in ascending order in the sorted region.
* q4: What must you track?
* a4: We must track the number of swaps and the element that was swapped for each pass.
